# Assist Platform Enterprise release notes

This is the chronological release index. Detailed historical deployment records
may remain as dated files and are linked here rather than copied.

## Unreleased

### Consolidated enterprise workstream

- Established Assist Platform Enterprise as the single product and governance
  direction for VanAssist, TowSmart, TrailerWise and LocalTorque.
- Consolidated product, architecture, UX, backlog, engineering and operational
  documentation into one version-controlled project memory.
- Continued the current UX redesign as the official Design System foundation.
- Organised delivery into Platform, Experience, Brands, Data, Infrastructure,
  Operations and Commercial streams.
- Continued unified admin, Data Sources and Data Intelligence work without
  creating a competing implementation.
- Completed CORE-004's shared membership catalogue and honest provider dashboard
  state. Paid selection and charging remain disabled pending COM-004 acceptance.
- Completed INF-003's fail-closed environment and integration configuration
  contract, corrected the free-plan example and documented secret rotation.
- Added OPS-006's repository-backed living documentation system with seven
  guide sections, global search and audience/brand/module/version filters,
  contextual dashboard Help links, mobile/accessibility treatment and a What's
  new view. Administrator/developer/API material remains behind the admin role
  gate; public help exposes only customer/provider and release information.
- Added CI and pull-request enforcement so changed public, customer, provider,
  administrator or API behaviour must update the matching registered guide and
  these release notes. No migration or environment change is required.

Production status: not released. A dated release entry requires a passed Platform
Quality Gate and verified deployment record.
